Write a basic tax calculator in Python.

It should take as input a currency, product code and price of the product, e.g.,
"GBP ABC123 2.50" would output something like:

    VAT on Bread worth £2.50 in the United Kingdom is £0.50 (20%)

Your calculator must handle the following scenarios:

    * United Kingdom
        * Tax on a 75cl bottle of wine is £2.00
        * Tax on cigarettes is 25%

    * Germany
        * Tax on cigarettes is 30%
        * The first €2 on all products is not taxable

    * All currencies and products otherwise are taxed at 10%

Write your calculator in such a way that it will be easy to extend (think about
how you would add extra currencies with wacky tax laws).
